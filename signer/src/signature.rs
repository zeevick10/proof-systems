//! Mina signature structure and associated helpers
//!
//! This module provides the core signature functionality for the Mina protocol.
//! Signatures in Mina are based on Schnorr signatures over elliptic curves,
//! specifically using the Pallas curve and its associated scalar field.
//!
//! The signature scheme is compatible with the signature scheme used in the
//! Mina protocol, and follows the standard Schnorr signature construction.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```rust
//! use mina_signer::{Signature, BaseField, ScalarField};
//!
//! // Create a new signature from field elements
//! let rx = BaseField::from(42u64);
//! let s = ScalarField::from(123u64);
//! let signature = Signature::new(rx, s);
//!
//! // Display signature as hexadecimal string
//! println!("Signature: {}", signature);
//! ```

/// A Schnorr signature for the Mina protocol.
///
/// This structure represents a cryptographic signature that consists of two
/// components:
/// - `rx`: The x-coordinate of the commitment point R, represented as a base
///   field element
/// - `s`: The signature scalar, computed as `s = k + r * private_key` where `k`
///   is a random nonce
///
/// The signature follows the standard Schnorr signature scheme adapted for
/// Mina's elliptic curve choice (Pallas curve). This ensures compatibility with
/// the Mina blockchain's verification requirements.
///
/// # Security Properties
///
/// - **Unforgeability**: Cannot be forged without knowledge of the private key
/// - **Non-malleability**: Signature cannot be modified to create a valid
///   signature for a different message
/// - **Deterministic**: Given the same message and private key, produces the
///   same signature (when using deterministic nonce generation)
///
/// # Field Element Encoding
///
/// - `rx` is encoded as a base field element (typically Fp for Pallas curve)
/// - `s` is encoded as a scalar field element (typically Fq for Pallas curve)
///
/// Both components are essential for signature verification and must be
/// preserved with full precision during serialization and transmission.
